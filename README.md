# Feature-Engineering-Projects
I have performed all the techniques of feature engineering and feature transformation by taking different datasets. 

# Life cycle of Data Science Projects:
1. Data Collection
2. Feature Engineering
   -> Handling missing values
   -> Handling outliers
   -> Encoding Categorical values
   -> Feature scaling (standardization and normalization)
   -> Tranforming features
   -> Handling imbalanced data
   -> Remove unwanted columns
